# Example Meteor app in Civet language

This is Meteor's starting React app from `meteor create --react --typescript`,
translated into the [Civet](https://civet.dev) language.

It mainly serves to test the
[`edemaine:civet`](https://github.com/edemaine/meteor-civet)
package for Civet support in Meteor.

It also shows off
[Civet's beautiful JSX support](https://civet.dev/reference#jsx).
Check out [`Info.civet`](imports/ui/Info.civet) for example.
